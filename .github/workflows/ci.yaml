  # Runs tests using wazero inside a minimal golang docker image. This makes sure the code builds
  # even when there is no C toolchain available. It is possible for code to work fine with CGO_ENABLED=0
  # but not build without a C toolchain available, e.g. if C source files are checked into the repo
  # without a build tag to exclude them from pure-Go builds.
